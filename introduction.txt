In Japan, summer usually kicks into gear in mid July after the rainy season, which lasts for most of June, is over. However, the Meteorological Agency of Japan declared an end to the season for many areas including Tokyo on June 27, which was 22 days earlier than normal, marking the earliest end to the rainy season since 1951.
