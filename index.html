                    In Japan, summer heat usually kicks into gear in mid July after the rainy season, 
                    which lasts for more than a month, is over. However, this year, 
                    the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared the earliest end to the annual 
                    rainy season for Tokyo and neighboring areas in the Kanto-Koshin region, eastern 
                    and central part of Japan, on June 27. It was 22 days earlier than normal and 
                    the first time for a June.

                    As the rains that temper summer heat, usually well into July, are already gone, 
                    this year sees the earliest and worst heatwave in Japan’s history, with the daily 
                    maximum temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celcius (95 Fahrenheit) for record-setting 
                    9 straight days from June 25 to Jul 3.

                    Heatwaves are becoming more frequent and more intense due to climate change. 
                    Before 1999, the number of days with the maximum temperature over 35 degrees Celcius 
                    in Tokyo was below 1 for every month on average. 
                    However, the numbers had increased to 1.4 in July and 2.0 in August in 2000’s, 
                    to 2.4 in July and 4.9 in August in 2010's. 
                    The recent 3 years in 2020’s saw even further jump, with 2.0 in June, 1.0 in July and 6.5 in August.

                    A historic heatwave not only caused thousands of people to be hospitalized with 
                    heatstroke or heat exhaustion, but it also triggered a power crunch due to the 
                    increased use of air conditioning.

                <p>
                    As the power grid in Tokyo and surrounding areas creaked under the strain of severe heat, 
                    authorities started to request business and the public to reduce energy consumption 
                    to avoid blackouts. The electricity consumption rate, 
                    the amount of electricity usage divided by its supply, rose to as much as 97 percent in late June, 
                    risking the capital city and surrounding areas, with the population of 45 million, 
                    plunging into a blackout.
