                    In Japan, summer heat usually kicks into gear in mid July after the rainy season, 
                    which lasts for more than a month, is over. However, this year, 
                    the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared the earliest end to the annual 
                    rainy season for Tokyo and neighboring areas in the Kanto-Koshin region, eastern 
                    and central part of Japan, on June 27. It was 22 days earlier than normal and 
                    the first time for a June.

                    As the rains that temper summer heat, usually well into July, are already gone, 
                    this year sees the earliest and worst heatwave in Japan’s history, with the daily 
                    maximum temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celcius (95 Fahrenheit) for record-setting 
                    9 straight days from June 25 to Jul 3.

                    Heatwaves are becoming more frequent and more intense due to climate change. 
                    Before 1999, the number of days with the maximum temperature over 35 degrees Celcius 
                    in Tokyo used to be below 1 for every month on average. 
                    However, 2000’s saw 1.4 in July and 2.0 in August. In 2010’s, 
                    the numbers had increased to  2.4 in July and 4.9 in August. For the recent 3 years in 2020’s, 
                    it jumps furthermore to 2 in June, 1 in July and 6.5 in August.
