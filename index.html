                    In Japan, summer heat usually kicks into gear in mid July after the rainy season, 
                    which lasts for more than a month, is over. However, this year, 
                    the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) declared the earliest end to the annual 
                    rainy season for Tokyo and neighboring areas in the Kanto-Koshin region, eastern 
                    and central part of Japan, on June 27. It was 22 days earlier than normal and 
                    the first time for a June.

                    As the rains that temper summer heat, usually well into July, are already gone, 
                    this year sees the earliest and worst heatwave in Japan’s history, with the daily 
                    maximum temperatures exceeding 35 degrees Celcius (95 Fahrenheit) for record-setting 
                    9 straight days from June 25 to Jul 3.

                    Heatwaves are becoming more frequent and more intense due to climate change. 
                    Before 1999, the number of days with the maximum temperature over 35 degrees Celcius 
                    in Tokyo was below 1 for every month on average. 
                    However, the numbers had increased to 1.4 in July and 2.0 in August in 2000’s, 
                    to 2.4 in July and 4.9 in August in 2010's. 
                    The recent 3 years in 2020’s saw even further jump, with 2.0 in June, 1.0 in July and 6.5 in August.

                    A historic heatwave not only caused thousands of people to be hospitalized with 
                    heatstroke or heat exhaustion, but it also triggered a power crunch due to the 
                    increased use of air conditioning.

                    As the power grid in Tokyo and surrounding areas creaked under the strain of severe heat, 
                    authorities started to request business and the public to reduce energy consumption 
                    to avoid blackouts. The electricity consumption rate, 
                    the amount of electricity usage divided by its supply, rose to as much as 97 percent in late June, 
                    risking the capital city and surrounding areas, with the population of 45 million, 
                    plunging into a blackout.

                    A severe heat is also a reminder that Japan’s energy supply is still walking on a tightrope. 
                    Since the Great East Japan earthquake and subsequent Fukushima nuclear disaster in 2011, 
                    Japan’s energy policy has been in paralysis. With opposition to nuclear remaining strong 
                    among Japanese people, especially those who live in the neighborhoods of nuclear power plants, 
                    out of a total of 54 nuclear reactors in Japan, 50 are either idled or under decommissioning process 
                    as of June 2022.

                    Lacking most of the nuclear power generation, which used to supply more than 
                    a quarter of the country’s electricity before the Fukushima accident, 
                    Japan has no other options than to rely heavily on fossil fuels even 
                    though it pledges to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. 
                </p>

                    With the electricity shortage coincidentally happening amid the global energy crisis 
                    due to the war in Ukraine and Russian sanctions, “Japan has to tackle an interactable 
                    and pressing problem by investing in non-fossil energy sources, ” said Shunsuke Kobayashi, 
                    the chief economist at Mizuho Securities, in a report. As extreme weather events due 
                    to climate change are likely to occur frequently in the next decades, the need for 
                    a new energy mix, including renewable energies and technologies, is urgent.
